## Problem 1

After cleaning the initial NYC transit dataset, the resulting dataset is
described by **19** variables, which are: **line, station_name,
station_latitude, station_longitude, route1, route2, route3, route4,
route5, route6, route7, route8, route9, route10, route11, entrance_type,
entry, vending, ada**. This dataset is **1868** rows by **19** columns.
The initial cleaning steps included changing column names to make sure
they were all formatted the same way (in snake_case), removing certain
columns not necessary for data analysis, and converting the the
variables under the entry column into logical variables. Because the
routes are all seperated into different columns, this data isnâ€™t tidy.
To tidy, the dataset would contain one column that held the information
for route number and another column that held the information on whether
there was a train that followed that route at each location.
