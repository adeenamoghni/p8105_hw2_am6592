## Problem 1

After cleaning the initial NYC transit dataset, the resulting dataset is
described by **19** variables, which are: **line, station_name,
station_latitude, station_longitude, route1, route2, route3, route4,
route5, route6, route7, route8, route9, route10, route11, entrance_type,
entry, vending, ada**. This dataset is **1868** rows by **19** columns.
The initial cleaning steps included changing column names to make sure
they were all formatted the same way (in snake_case), removing certain
columns not necessary for data analysis, and converting the data points
under the entry column into logical variables. Because the routes are
all separated into different columns, this data isnâ€™t tidy. To tidy, the
data set would contain one column that held the information for route
number and another column that held the information on whether there was
a train that followed that route at each location.

There are **465** distinct stations.

There are **84** ADA compliant stations.

The proportion of stations with no vending that allow entry is
**0.5555556**

There are **60** distinct stations that serve the A train. Of these
stations, **17** are ADA compliant
